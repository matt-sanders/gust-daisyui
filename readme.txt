Gust support for the Daisy UI component library.

== Description ==

[Gust](https://www.getgust.com) is Tailwind CSS for WordPress. It's a WordPress theme that provides a deep integration with Tailwind CSS via its page builder. [Daisy UI](https://daisyui.com/) is "the most popular component library for Tailwind CSS" and adds component class names to Tailwind CSS so you can make beautiful websites faster than ever.

This plugin adds the Daisy UI components to the Gust component library, allowing you to drag and drop those components into your page. No CSS or Tailwind CSS knowledge is required!

== Installation ==

Once you have the plugin installed, make sure you add Daisy UI to your Tailwind config. You can find further installation and configuration instructions in the [Gust docs](https://www.getgust.com/docs/daisyui) and the [Daisy UI docs](https://daisyui.com/docs/install/).
