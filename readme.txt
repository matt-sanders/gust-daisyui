Gust support for the daisyUI component library.

== Description ==

[Gust](https://www.getgust.com) is Tailwind CSS for WordPress. It's a WordPress theme that provides a deep integration with Tailwind CSS via its page builder. [daisyUI](https://daisyui.com/) is "the most popular component library for Tailwind CSS" and adds component class names to Tailwind CSS so you can make beautiful websites faster than ever.

This plugin adds the daisyUI components to the Gust component library, allowing you to drag and drop those components into your page. No CSS or Tailwind CSS knowledge is required!
